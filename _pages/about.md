My name is Jitu Ewnetu, and I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Software Engineering at Addis Ababa University. My academic journey is driven by a passion for technology and innovation, particularly in how these can be harnessed to address societal challenges and create meaningful change.

Beyond my studies, I am deeply invested in social impact and youth empowerment. I believe in the transformative power of technology not just as a tool for development, but as a catalyst for enabling the next generation to achieve their full potential. 

Through various initiatives, I am committed to bridging the gap between technology and social good, working towards a future where youth are not only beneficiaries of change but also active agents in driving it
