My name is Jitu Ewnetu 😊. I am a recent Software Engineering graduate from Addis Ababa University. My academic journey has been driven by a passion for technology and innovation, particularly in how these can be harnessed to address societal challenges and create meaningful change.

I am currently working as a Software Engineer & Project Manager at [Abro Technologies ](https://www.abrotechnologies.net/). In this dual role, I contribute to coding and development while leading and managing two major projects, bridging technical execution with strategic oversight.

Beyond my technical work, I am deeply invested in social impact and youth empowerment. I believe in the transformative power of technology not just as a tool for development, but as a catalyst for enabling the next generation to achieve their full potential.

Through various initiatives, I am committed to bridging the gap between technology and social good, working towards a future where youth are not only beneficiaries of change but also active agents in driving it.
